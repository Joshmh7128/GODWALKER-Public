********************************

Requirements & Setup
--------------------
1) Volumetric Lights works only with Universal Rendering Pipeline
2) Make sure you have Universal RP package imported in the project before using Volumetric Lights.
3) Make sure you have a Universal Rendering Pipeline asset assigned to Project Settings / Graphics. There's a URP sample asset in Demo/URP Pipeline Settings folder.


Demo Scene
----------
There's a demo scene which lets you quickly check if Volumetric Lights is working correctly in your project.


Documentation
-------------
Please read the documentation folder for additional instructions and options.

Future updates
--------------
All our assets follow an incremental development process by which a few beta releases are published on our support forum (kronnect.com).
We encourage you to signup and engage our forum. The forum is the primary support and feature discussions medium.

Of course, all updates of Volumetric Lights will be eventually available on the Asset Store.


Version history
---------------

Current version
- [Fix] Fixed material issue when a light is duplicated in Unity Editor

- Added "Dust Prewarm" option. By default, dust particles are prewarmed/populated during activation. This behaviour can be disabled to gain performance when activating many lights at the same time.

v6.7
- Improved rendering of large area lights

v6.6.1
- Optimized mesh data reuse / generation based on settings change

v6.6
- Added "Local Space" option to "Use Custom Bounds"
- Improved generation of volumetric light area on directional lights

v6.5.2
- Option to ignore reflection probes in the depth pre-pass render feature
- The volumetric lights render feature now excludes reflection probes based on its culling mask
- [Fix] Fixed issue with translucency rendering in newly created lights that required additional initialization

v6.4
- Translucency script: option to preserve original transparent shader
- Translucency effect uses also Lit shader base color

v6.3
- Added "Blend Mode" option to Cast Direct Light feature

v6.2

- Added button to post process inspector to quickly return to latest selected volumetric light
- Fixes

- Removed macro console warning in Unity 2020.1
- When "Sync With Profile" is enabled, properties in inspector are now readonly
- Using cookie texture no longer requires occlusion cam improving performance

v4.1
- Simplification. It's no longer required to create a volumetric light profile to use the effect.
- Timeline support is now simpler. The VolumetricLightAnimation is no longer used. Instead you can modify directly the VolumetricLight fields.
